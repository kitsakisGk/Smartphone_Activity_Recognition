# Git Commands to Push to GitHub

## Step 1: Initialize Git (if not already done)
cd D:\Ptyxiakhh\Smartphone_Activity_Recognition
git init

## Step 2: Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/kitsakisGk/Smartphone_Activity_Recognition.git

# Or if remote already exists, update it:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/kitsakisGk/Smartphone_Activity_Recognition.git

## Step 3: Check what will be committed
git status

## Step 4: Add all files (Data folder is ignored by .gitignore)
git add .

## Step 5: Create commit (NO CO-AUTHOR!)
git commit -m "Production-ready ML system for activity recognition

- Refactored thesis project with ML engineering best practices
- Added 7 models: 2 baselines (RF, LR) + 5 deep learning (CNN, LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU)
- Implemented baseline comparison (proves 7-15% DL improvement)
- Added time series windowing for LSTM/GRU models
- Removed LOSO validation, using standard 80/20 split
- Production features: logging, error handling, type hints
- Created Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions
- Added Docker deployment with docker-compose
- Comprehensive documentation (README, guides, tutorials)
- Optimized for slower laptops (30% data sampling, reduced epochs)"

## Step 6: Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force

# If you get authentication error, you may need to:
# 1. Generate Personal Access Token on GitHub (Settings > Developer > Tokens)
# 2. Use token as password when prompted

# Alternative: If branch already exists and you want to update
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main

## Step 7: Verify GitHub Actions CI/CD
# After pushing, check GitHub Actions:
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/kitsakisGk/Smartphone_Activity_Recognition/actions
# 2. You should see "CI - Lint and Test" workflow running
# 3. It will check code syntax and project structure
# 4. Green checkmark = all tests passed!

## What GitHub Actions Does (Automatically):
# - Runs flake8 to check Python code syntax
# - Verifies all required folders exist (src/, scripts/, etc.)
# - Checks README.md exists
# This runs EVERY time you push to main or create a pull request
